 # Project Title / Headline
Inventory and Supply Chain Optimization through Interactive Dashboard Analytics,
Enhancing Decision-Making with Data-Driven Insights into Inventory and Supply Chain Performance"

# Short Description / Purpose
This project aims to analyze and optimize inventory and supply chain operations using an interactive Power BI dashboard. By visualizing key metrics such as stock levels, order performance, supplier efficiency, and demand trends, the dashboard enables data-driven decision-making, reduces operational inefficiencies, and supports strategic planning for inventory control and supply chain management.

# Tech Stack:
Power BI: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and report generation.

Microsoft Excel / CSV: Used as the primary data source format for importing inventory and supply chain data.

Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and modeling within Power BI.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated measures, KPIs, and custom data logic in Power BI.

Power BI Service (optional): For publishing and sharing the dashboard online (if applicable).

# Data Source : open Source kaggle 
The dataset used for this project was imported in Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) and CSV format. It includes simulated data representing real-world inventory and supply chain operations such as:
Product master data (IDs, categories, descriptions)
Stock levels and reorder points
Purchase and sales order history
Supplier information and performance metrics
Delivery timelines and warehouse data

# Features / Highlights:
- Inventory Overview: Real-time insights into stock levels, reorder points, and inventory valuation.

- Order Tracking: Visualization of purchase and sales order status, volume, and fulfillment trends.

- Supplier Performance Dashboard: Analysis of supplier lead times, reliability, and delivery accuracy.

- Demand & Trend Analysis: Monthly and yearly trends for demand forecasting and planning.

- Location-Based Insights: Distribution of stock and orders across different warehouses or regions.

- Alerts & Exceptions: Identification of overstocked, understocked, and slow-moving items.

- Interactive Filters & Slicers: Dynamic filtering by product, supplier, region, or time period for deep analysis.

- KPI Metrics: Display of key performance indicators like order cycle time, fill rate, and inventory turnover.

- Decision Support: Supports cost-saving decisions, space optimization, and better supply chain strategy.
